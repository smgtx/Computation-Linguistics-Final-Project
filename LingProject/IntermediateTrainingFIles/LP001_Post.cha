	Post-Tx Cat Rescue

*LV001:	okay I would say it starts out with the cat being up in a tree and
	the little girl really wanting the cat to come down so that she
	could play with him . [*com]
*LV001:	and since she was probably hollering at the cat it brought the dog
	to come over . [*com]
*LV001:	and it was barking . [*com]
*LV001:	it probably didn't know what it was barking about . [*com]
*LV001:	but 0det barking because the cow I mean the cat was up there I
	guess . [+gram]
*LV001:	and &uh then &uh it looks like <she may have called> [/] she may
	have called her dad to get a ladder to get up to <where the tree>
	[//] where he could get onto the tree . [*com]
*LV001:	but he seemed a little concerned that he might fall . [*com]
*LV001:	and it looks like he might have dropped the ladder which kept him
	from getting down . [*com]
*LV001:	so I guess the dad got on his &uh [ipod] and called the police
	[:fire][*][*s:r] department . [*com]
*LV001:	and &uh the fire department came and grabbed the ladder and helped
	the dad get down from the tree . [*com]
*LV001:	and during all this time here the bird <was swing> [//] was &s
	singing . [*com]
*LV001:	and the fire department helped get the cat and the dad . [*com]
*LV001:	and <when they> [//] when she got the cat down she rode off on her
	tricycle . [*com]
