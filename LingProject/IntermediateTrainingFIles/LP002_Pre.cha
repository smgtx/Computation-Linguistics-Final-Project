*LV001:	well a little girl &uh who was riding a tricycle saw a man up in
	a tree who appeared that he couldn't get out any further to grab the
	cat . [*com]
*LV001:	and the dog was barking at the bottom . [*com]
*LV001:	 I guess helping him to get the cat down . [*com]
*LV001:	so someone must have called &uh the fire department . [*com]
*LV001:	and they brought &um a ladder . [*com]
*LV001:	oh it looks like maybe that someone had had a ladder there but the
	ladder must have fallen down . [*com]
